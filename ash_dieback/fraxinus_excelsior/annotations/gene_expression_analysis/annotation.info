required: "program,version,os,run_parameters,target,sources"

program: "We ran tophat-2.0.3 alignments of AT1 and ATU1 reads against the ATU1 trinity assembly. Then we used samtools to convert the sam file into bam format. Next we assessed the number of reads aligning to each transcript using unix command "grep "NH:i:1" |cut -f 3 | uniq -c > output_name""
#os the analysis ran on, one of linux, osx, windows will be sufficient
os: "linux"
##program options used, command line options will do here (take out filenames and program name etc)
run_parameters: Tophat "-r 200"

##database or reference sequences being annotated, should also be in crowdsource repository and should be described here with its repository address. See README for more info.
Expression analysis: ""

##sources for annotation prior information, eg. EST or HMMs used for gene-callers etc, alignment file for SNP calls etc

sources: ""
