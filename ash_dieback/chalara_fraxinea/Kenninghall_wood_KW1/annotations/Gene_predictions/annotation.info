#metadata definition file for annotations generated in the ash dieback project
#please fill in all the items listed in the required list
#please fill in as many items as possible in the optional list

#lines beginning with # are comments and will be ignored


required: "program,version,os,run_parameters,target,sources"

program: "https://github.com/danmaclean/h_pseu_analysis/blob/master/extend.rb"
version: "1"
#os the analysis ran on, one of linux, osx, windows will be sufficient
os: "OSX"
##program options used, command line options will do here (take out filenames and program name etc)
run_parameters: ""

##database or reference sequences being annotated, should also be in crowdsource repository and should be described here with its repository address. See README for more info.
target: "ash_dieback/chalara_fraxinea/Kenninghall_wood_KW1/assemblies/gDNA/KW1_assembly_version1/Chalara_fraxinea_TGAC_s1v1_scaffolds.fa"

##sources for annotation prior information, eg. EST or HMMs used for gene-callers etc, alignment file for SNP calls etc

sources: "ash_dieback/chalara_fraxinea/Kenninghall_wood_KW1/annotations/Gene_predictions/TGAC_Chalara_fraxinea_ass_s1v1_ann_v1.1/Chalara_fraxinea_ass_s1v1_ann_v1.1.gene.gff"

#Align the RNAseq reads from KW1 against the KW1 assembly, using BWA
#For each `gene` model in the TGAC gene predictions, that was within 100nt of another gene I extracted reads on the same strand that fell within -1000nt  of the start or 1000nt of the end
#With these reads, starting with the start and end of the gene I followed read overlaps as far as possible, until reads no longer overlapped. The most distal read then counted as the new gene start/end.
